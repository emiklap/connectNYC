## 🌆 **About**
> Welcome to connectNYC, a website dedicated to connecting New Yorkers with their fellow community members. This is a platform for users to share any and all information related to the various neighborhoods in NYC. Not only is this a great way for users to explore new neighborhoods, but this is also a place for neighbors to discuss important issues within their community.

## ✨ **What Inspired Us** 
> We were inspired by the modern-day segregation that exists in our city as a result of many historical and ongoing issues such as red-lining and gentrification. Our city is a hub of many cultures, yet many residents across New York City don't venture out of the inner city atmosphere to go explore. We wish to bridge this gap so that all New Yorkers, rich or poor, Black or White, English-Speaking or Not, can begin to appreciate and critically think about the city around them.

## 💡 **Next Steps for ConnectNYC**
Future goals include implementing a filter/tagging feature for the neighborhoods, getting around to fixing authentication so that profiles can be probably saved in one database, creating posts in real time, recommended activity, and geolocation for relevant information.
